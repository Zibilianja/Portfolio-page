        <h2><u>Intro</u></h2>
        <p>
          My name is Jonathan and I am from Denver Colorado and moved back here
          from Portland Oregon in 2013. As most Coloradans I have a passion for
          the outdoors. As such, there is no better place to be. On my free time
          you can find me rock climbing, hiking, fly-fishing, biking...
          essentially, you're likely find me outside.
        </p>

        <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <p>
          My first career and still a passion of mine is in mental health
          therapy. I got my Master's degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling
          in 2018 and worked in my private therapy practice since then. In that
          process I have worked with many people and over time, I discovered
          that I didn't want therapy to be my primary source of income. I intend
          one day to get a small private practice back on the side, but I didn't
          like how the pressure of having enough clients to make a stable income
          impacted the work that I did with people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of my studies in psychology and work experience, I have
          developed a lot of my communication skills and am quite effective at
          working with other people. I know how to take the lead when necessary
          and also how to step back and follow. I know how to effectively listen
          and ask the right questions. I am excited to see how these skills
          might apply to the tech world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always had a passion for technology and a deep fascination with
          how it all works. 2020 was a year of intimate reflection for all of us
          and for me, it helped me see that I wanted to pursue that passion for
          technology and learn to code. I began to teach myself through programs
          like FreeCodeCamp.org, TheOdinProject, Udemy courses in Python and
          Javascript. I discovered that I enjoyed coding a whole lot and so I
          began looking for programs to really solidify my skills and pursue
          this as a career. I began the flex program with Thinkful bootcamp in
          June of 2021.
